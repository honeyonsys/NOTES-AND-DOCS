## **B U B B L E   S O R T**  
### **Problem Statement**  
Given an unsorted array, sort it in **ascending order** using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.  

---

### **Real-World Example: Arranging Books by Height**  
Imagine you have a row of books on a shelf, but they are in random order based on height. You want to arrange them from **shortest to tallest** using the following approach:  
1. Compare the first two books. If the first book is **taller**, swap them.  
2. Move to the next pair and do the same.  
3. Repeat this process for the entire row until no swaps are needed.  

This is exactly how **Bubble Sort** works! The heaviest (largest) item "bubbles up" to the end with each pass.  

---

### **Solution Explanation**  
1. **Compare adjacent elements** in the array.  
2. **Swap them** if they are in the wrong order.  
3. **Repeat** the process for all elements, reducing the comparison range in each pass.  
4. Stop when no swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.  

### **Time Complexity**  
- **Best Case:** \(O(n)\) (if the array is already sorted)  
- **Average & Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) (when the array is in reverse order)  

---

### **Java Code Implementation (Optimized Bubble Sort)**  
```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;

            // Last i elements are already sorted, so no need to check them
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) { 
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no two elements were swapped, the array is already sorted
            if (!swapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        System.out.println("Original Array:");
        printArray(arr);

        bubbleSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted Array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Bubble Sort?**
- **Simple to understand and implement.**  
- **Works well for small datasets.**  
- **Not efficient for large datasets due to \(O(n^2)\) complexity.**

Here’s a structured explanation of **Selection Sort**, including a real-world example.  

---

## ** S E L E C T I O N   S O R T**  
### **Problem Statement**  
Given an unsorted array, sort it in **ascending order** using the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  

---

### **Real-World Example: Arranging Students by Height**  
Imagine a group of students standing in a line in random order. You want to arrange them from **shortest to tallest** using the following approach:  
1. Find the **shortest** student in the group.  
2. Swap them with the **first** student in the line.  
3. Find the next **shortest** student from the remaining group and swap them with the **second** student.  
4. Repeat the process until the entire line is sorted.  

This is exactly how **Selection Sort** works!  

---

### **Solution Explanation**  
1. **Find the smallest element** in the unsorted portion of the array.  
2. Swap it with the **first element** of the unsorted portion.  
3. Move to the next element and **repeat** the process until the array is sorted.  

### **Time Complexity**  
- **Best, Average & Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) (since it always goes through the full array to find the minimum)  
- **Advantage:** Unlike Bubble Sort, **Selection Sort** makes fewer swaps, making it more efficient in terms of memory writes.  

---

### **Java Code Implementation**  
```java
public class SelectionSort {
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i; // Assume the first element is the smallest
            
            // Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
        System.out.println("Original Array:");
        printArray(arr);

        selectionSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted Array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Selection Sort?**
✅ **Fewer swaps than Bubble Sort** (better for memory-limited environments).  
✅ **Easy to implement and understand.**  
❌ **Not efficient for large datasets** (\(O(n^2)\) complexity).

## **Bubble Sort**  
### **Problem Statement**  
Given an unsorted array, sort it in **ascending order** using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.  

---

### **Real-World Example: Arranging Books by Height**  
Imagine you have a row of books on a shelf, but they are in random order based on height. You want to arrange them from **shortest to tallest** using the following approach:  
1. Compare the first two books. If the first book is **taller**, swap them.  
2. Move to the next pair and do the same.  
3. Repeat this process for the entire row until no swaps are needed.  

This is exactly how **Bubble Sort** works! The heaviest (largest) item "bubbles up" to the end with each pass.  

---

### **Solution Explanation**  
1. **Compare adjacent elements** in the array.  
2. **Swap them** if they are in the wrong order.  
3. **Repeat** the process for all elements, reducing the comparison range in each pass.  
4. Stop when no swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.  

### **Time Complexity**  
- **Best Case:** \(O(n)\) (if the array is already sorted)  
- **Average & Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) (when the array is in reverse order)

### **Java Code Implementation (Optimized Bubble Sort)**  
```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        boolean swapped;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;

            // Last i elements are already sorted, so no need to check them
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) { 
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no two elements were swapped, the array is already sorted
            if (!swapped) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        System.out.println("Original Array:");
        printArray(arr);

        bubbleSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted Array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### **Why Use Bubble Sort?**
- **Simple to understand and implement.**  
- **Works well for small datasets.**  
- **Not efficient for large datasets due to \(O(n^2)\) complexity.**

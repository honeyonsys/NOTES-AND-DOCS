## **Problem Statement**  
Given an unsorted array, sort it in **ascending order** using the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  

---

## **Real-World Example: Arranging Students by Height**  
Imagine a group of students standing in a line in random order. You want to arrange them from **shortest to tallest** using the following approach:  
1. Find the **shortest** student in the group.  
2. Swap them with the **first** student in the line.  
3. Find the next **shortest** student from the remaining group and swap them with the **second** student.  
4. Repeat the process until the entire line is sorted.  

This is exactly how **Selection Sort** works!  

---

## **Solution Explanation**  
1. **Find the smallest element** in the unsorted portion of the array.  
2. Swap it with the **first element** of the unsorted portion.  
3. Move to the next element and **repeat** the process until the array is sorted.  

## **Time Complexity**  
- **Best, Average & Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) (since it always goes through the full array to find the minimum)  
- **Advantage:** Unlike Bubble Sort, **Selection Sort** makes fewer swaps, making it more efficient in terms of memory writes.

## **Java Code Implementation**  
```java
public class SelectionSort {
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int minIndex = i; // Assume the first element is the smallest
            
            // Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                    minIndex = j;
                }
            }

            // Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
        System.out.println("Original Array:");
        printArray(arr);

        selectionSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted Array:");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

## **Why Use Selection Sort?**
✅ **Fewer swaps than Bubble Sort** (better for memory-limited environments).  
✅ **Easy to implement and understand.**  
❌ **Not efficient for large datasets** (\(O(n^2)\) complexity).
